###Problem Two

---
To execute this program you need:

- Ruby installed
- *Ruby version I used*: 2.1.2p95

###Steps


1. Download the sources
2. cd to problem_one folder
3. Make sure the appropriate input is in `perm_input.txt`
4. run `ruby main.rb`
5. Check the out put file `perm_output.txt`

##NOTES:

- The problem says "permutaci√≥n de una subsecuencia", so for example the output for these two lines: `walking` and `down` would not only be `nw` but also `wn`. This is because `wn` is also a permutation of a common subsecuence between the two strings.
